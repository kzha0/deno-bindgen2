# Example

This is an example library to showcase how `deno-bindgen2` works and what it can do

## To build

First, make sure you have already [installed `deno-bindgen2-cli`](../../README.md#to-use)

Then run `deno-bindgen2` from this directory to generate the FFI bindings

Finally, run `deno test --allow-ffi ./example.ts`
